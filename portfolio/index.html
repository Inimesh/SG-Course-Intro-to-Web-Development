                    <p>I am an aspiring Software Developer/Engineer with an interest in both
                        data science and web development. I graduated from the
                        University of
                        Manchester in 2019 with Masters in Chemistry (1st) and I am looking
                        to enter into the field of technology off the back of an enjoyable and rewarding exposure
                        to applied programming and computer science concepts I had during my
                        degree course. I am keen to learn as much as I can in this early stage
                        in my career and get my foot-in-the-door in the world of tech and to
                        focus mainly on my learning and self-development.</p>

                    <!-- <p> My first experince in programming was in a introductory computer
                        science course that I took as an optional unit while on a university
                        exchange year at the Univerisy of Calgary, Canada. This experience sparked
                        my initial enjoyment in applied programming but also an interest for
                        computer science in general. In this module I learned some of the core
                        principles of computer sceince and gained initial experience programming
                        using Python.</p>

                    <p>In the following academic year I used MATLAB in a 'computational
                        chemistry' module simulating electron orbitals and molecular dynamics.
                        Since graduating I have had further experience with MATLAB in a
                        Stanford University online learning course about machine learning, where
                        machine learning models such as linear regression, NNs, SVMs and clustering
                        were programmed from the underlying linear algebra principles. I have
                        also completed two Algorithms and Data Structures online courses,
                        also provided by Stanford.</p>

                    <p>I have also imporved my Python programming proficiency. I have been
                        working with a fintech startup <em>'Winston'</em>, providing data analysis for
                        market research. This involved putting together a survey
                        for the intended market and cleaning and analysing the returned raw data.
                        For this I used Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to clean, analyse and
                        create visual representations to present my findings to the rest of the team.
                        It was an invaluable expereince to be a part of a small start-up team and
                        gain hands on experience in data analysis and an insight into the early
                        stages and development of a tech startup.</p>

                    <p>I have also completed a personal project where I have built
                        a calculator aiming to help synthetic chemists avoid tedious reactant
                        scaling calculations. This was a problem I found while working on my
                        masters project and so I wanted to apply what I have learned and create
                        a tool to solve this problem.</p> -->
